#Solarity theme

Solarity is a stark, minimalist WordPress theme developed by Ben Beekman for internationally renowned artist Peter Erskineâ€™s portfolio site, erskinesolarart.net.

The theme features a heavily customized gallery post template with Google Maps integration, a "Yoast SEO-friendly" content field split at the "more" tag that populates both the galleries in the main column and descriptions in the sidebar, a mobile-friendly responsive design, extensive post and page customizability, and intelligent re-use of all common structural elements to reduce redundant structure.
